### Caddy
Caddy is functioning as a **reverse proxy** and **static file server** in this setup.

* Reverse Proxy: Caddy forwards incoming HTTP(S) requests to the appropriate backend services (like api and client). The Caddyfile defines how requests are routed:

    * Requests to the base domain (e.g., https://your-domain.com) are forwarded to the client (frontend).
    * Requests to the API domain (e.g., https://api.your-domain.com) are forwarded to the api service.
* SSL Termination: Caddy handles HTTPS (SSL/TLS) by automatically obtaining and renewing SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

* Security Headers: Caddy adds security-related headers like Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options to protect the web application from common attacks (XSS, clickjacking, etc.).

* Rate Limiting: Caddy also includes rate limiting features to limit the number of requests from a particular client to protect the API from abuse or excessive requests.

* Environment in Caddy:

    * `DOMAIN_NAME`: Caddy uses the `DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable to dynamically configure the domain for which it serves traffic. This variable is referenced in the `Caddyfile` to set up reverse proxying for different subdomains.

#### Volumes and Their Uses
* In Docker Compose, volumes are used to persist data or share data between the host machine and containers.

### Docker
* It enables consistent, isolated environments for the application's services, making it easy to deploy, scale, and manage across different environments. 

* Dockerâ€™s isolated environments ensure that different services don't interfere with each other, while its consistent environments make sure the application runs the same way across different machines and stages (development, testing, production).

#### How the Network Works
Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other. In this case, the godown-treeapp network (defined as a `bridge` network) connects all the services (`mongo`, `api`, `client`, `caddy`) together.

* Bridge network: The bridge network type allows containers to communicate with each other by name (like `mongo`, `api`, `client`, and `caddy`).
    * For example, the `api` service can communicate with `mongo` using the hostname `mongo`, and the `client` service can communicate with `api` using the hostname `api`.
* Network Isolation: All services in the godown-treeapp network can talk to each other, but they are isolated from services outside this network unless explicitly exposed (like the `caddy` service is exposed to the internet through ports `80` and `443`).

## Backend

### Import statements
* `express`: The web framework used to build the API. It simplifies HTTP request handling, routing, and middleware usage.
* `mongoose`: This is the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library that helps interact with MongoDB, allowing you to define schemas and models.
* `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This ensures sensitive data like database URIs and API keys are not hardcoded in the source code.
* `cors`: Middleware that allows your server to accept requests from other origins (such as your frontend), preventing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors.

## Frontend

1. **Imports**: 
   - The code imports `React` and `ReactDOM` to utilize their capabilities for building and rendering components. It also imports `App` (the main application component) and `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` for routing functionality.

2. **Context Creation**:
   - A React context (`Context`) is created to manage global state, specifically for user authentication. This context will allow various components to access the authentication status without prop drilling.

3. **AppWrapper Component**:
   - The `AppWrapper` component is defined to manage the authentication state using the `useState` hook. It initializes an `isAuthenticated` state variable and provides a function to update this state (`setIsAuthenticated`).
   - The `App` component is wrapped inside the `Context.Provider`, passing down the authentication state. This allows any child component of `App` to access and modify the authentication status.

4. **Rendering the Application**:
   - The application is rendered into the root element (`<div id="root">`) using `ReactDOM.createRoot`.
   - The rendering is wrapped in `React.StrictMode`, which helps identify potential issues during development.
   - The `BrowserRouter` component is used to enable routing, allowing users to navigate through different parts of the application without refreshing the page.

#### Features Used

- **React**: For building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **ReactDOM**: For rendering React components to the DOM.
- **Hooks**: Specifically, `useState` for managing local state.
- **Context API**: For creating a context that manages global state.
- **React Router**: For enabling client-side routing in the application.
- **Strict Mode**: For identifying potential problems during development.
